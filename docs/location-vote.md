## Current Issues to Fix
1. ðŸ”´ Type Errors
   - Fix `locations` property type in GetPollApiResponse
   - Add proper typing for location and index parameters
   - Import VoteType type where needed

## Next Steps

### 1. Polish Location Table UI
- [ ] Add score summary for each location (like time slots have)
- [ ] Add hover states for rows and columns
- [ ] Add scroll shadows for horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Consider adding location details tooltip on hover
- [ ] Add loading states for vote changes
- [ ] Add success feedback for vote changes

### 2. Enhance Vote Confirmation UI
- [ ] Improve vote summary titles in confirmation modal
- [ ] Add clear feedback about what was voted on
- [ ] Show location details in vote summary
- [ ] Ensure consistent UX with time vote confirmation

### 3. Improve Voting Flow
- [ ] Remove tab-based navigation in favor of unified view
- [ ] Stack time and location voting vertically on the same page
- [ ] Consolidate save action to handle both vote types at once
- [ ] Ensure consistent participant creation flow with single form submission
- [ ] Fix voting state synchronization between time and location sections

### 4. UI Consistency Improvements
- [ ] Match participant representation between time and location sections
  - [ ] Use consistent styling for "You" row/column (currently grey in times, red in locations)
  - [ ] Align default vote states ("?" vs undefined)
  - [ ] Standardize vote type initialization (yes/no/if-need-be)
- [ ] Maintain distinct but complementary layouts
  - [ ] Keep time voting's row-based layout for dates/times
  - [ ] Keep location voting's column-based layout for better space utilization
  - [ ] Ensure visual hierarchy makes sense with stacked layout
- [ ] Unify interaction patterns
  - [ ] Standardize hover states
  - [ ] Match click behaviors
  - [ ] Align feedback animations

### 5. Testing & Mobile
- [ ] Add unit tests for location voting components
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness of table layout
- [ ] Test error cases and edge cases
- [ ] Test with large numbers of participants and locations
- [ ] Test voting flow across tabs

### 6. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add map preview when location is expanded
- [ ] Add location search/filter capabilities
- [ ] Consider grouping locations by area/distance
- [ ] Add location sorting options
- [ ] Consider adding location categories/tags

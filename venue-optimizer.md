## Technical Details

### Completed Schema Changes
```prisma
model Poll {
  // ... existing fields ...
  isLocationOptimized Boolean @default(false)
  venuePreferences    VenuePreferences?
}

model VenuePreferences {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  pollId        String   @unique
  poll          Poll     @relation(fields: [pollId], references: [id])
  venueType     String
  subType       String?
  minRating     Float?
  priceLevel    Int?     // 1-4
}

model ParticipantStartLocation {
  id            String      @id @default(cuid())
  participantId String      @unique
  participant   Participant @relation(fields: [participantId], references: [id])
  latitude      Float
  longitude     Float
  address       String?
  transportMode String      @default("driving")
  createdAt     DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime    @updatedAt
}
```

### Next Steps
1. Implement additional venue preferences:
   - Add price range selector using radio buttons or slider
   - Add rating selector with star visualization
   - Consider adding cuisine type for restaurants

2. Create participant location collection:
   - Design mobile-friendly location input
   - Implement geocoding for addresses
   - Add transport mode selection
   - Consider privacy implications

3. Set up venue optimization:
   - Create Google Places API service
   - Implement caching for API responses
   - Design ranking algorithm
   - Create venue suggestion UI

## Notes
- Core venue type selection is now implemented with official Google Places types
- Need to focus on additional preferences next
- Keep the UI simple and intuitive
- Consider rate limiting and API usage costs
- All features should work with the existing location voting system

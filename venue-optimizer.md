## Technical Details

### Completed Schema Changes
```prisma
model Poll {
  // ... existing fields ...
  isLocationOptimized Boolean @default(false)
  venuePreferences    VenuePreferences?
}

model VenuePreferences {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  pollId        String   @unique
  poll          Poll     @relation(fields: [pollId], references: [id])
  venueType     String
  subType       String?
  minRating     Float?
  priceLevel    Int?     // 1-4
}

model ParticipantStartLocation {
  id            String      @id @default(cuid())
  participantId String      @unique
  participant   Participant @relation(fields: [participantId], references: [id])
  latitude      Float
  longitude     Float
  address       String?
  transportMode String      @default("driving")
  createdAt     DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime    @updatedAt
}
```

### Current Status
1. âœ… Core UI Implementation:
   - Smart location toggle and preferences in poll creation
   - Venue type, price, and rating selectors
   - Clear badges showing preferences in poll view
   - Informative messaging about the optimization process

2. âœ… Participant Location Collection:
   - Location input with map component complete
   - Transportation mode selection implemented
   - Secure location storage with proper ordering
   - Pins and addresses match in chronological order
   - Temporary location handling working correctly

3. ðŸš§ Next Priority - UX Polish:
   - Add loading states and visual feedback
   - Optimize for mobile devices
   - Improve performance and caching
   - Add proper error handling

4. ðŸŽ¯ Future Work - Venue Optimization:
   - Develop venue search and ranking algorithm
   - Create suggestion UI with venue details
   - Implement travel time calculations
   - Add real-time updates as participants add locations

## Notes
- UI for venue preferences and location collection is now complete
- Map component successfully reused with proper functionality
- Location storage and ordering issues resolved
- Need to focus on UX polish and mobile optimization
- Consider rate limiting and API usage costs
- All features should work with the existing location voting system

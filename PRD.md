PRD – Rallly
Project Overview
Enhance the open-source Rallly platform by adding advanced location management features to make event planning more seamless and efficient. The features will include Google Maps integration, distance calculations, and an optimal location finder, all aimed at improving usability and engagement.

Features
1. Google Maps Integration
Description:
Allow event organizers to search and select multiple locations using a map-based interface.
Display selected locations as pins on a map for participants to view.
Enable participants to vote on their preferred locations.
Functional Requirements:
Organizer:
Search for locations using Google Places Autocomplete API.
Select and save multiple locations.
Participant:
View a map with proposed locations pinned.
Vote for preferred locations.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Intuitive UI/UX with minimal friction.
Real-time updates when participants vote.

2. Distance Viewer
Description:
Allow participants to input their location manually or auto-detect via browser geolocation.
Calculate and display the distance (and travel time) from the participant’s location to each proposed event location.
Provide an option to open the route in Google Maps.
Functional Requirements:
Distance calculation via Google Distance Matrix API.
UI feature to show travel times/distances for each location.
Privacy-first: Participant location is stored locally or securely on the server (not visible to others).
Non-Functional Requirements:
Support for multiple modes of transport (e.g., driving, walking, public transit).
Handle edge cases like participants not providing a location.

3. Optimal Location Finder
Description:
Optimize event location based on participant-provided locations to minimize overall travel distance.
Use Google Places API to suggest venues (e.g., "coffee shop") near the optimal point.
Functional Requirements:
Organizer:
Enable participants to submit their location anonymously.
Use participant locations to calculate a central point.
Query Google Places API to retrieve nearby venues of a specified type (e.g., restaurants, parks).
Display top 1-3 venue suggestions on a map for final selection.
Participant:
Input location securely and privately.
View optimized location suggestions.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Location suggestions must be accurate and relevant (filter by type, ratings, etc.).
Handle edge cases (e.g., widely dispersed participant locations).

Tech Stack
Frontend
Framework: Next.js
Server-side rendering for faster page loads and SEO-friendly maps.
UI Library: Tailwind CSS for styling (consistent and easy to maintain).
Map Integration:
Google Maps JavaScript API for map embedding, pin placement, and interactivity.
React libraries like react-google-maps/api (optional) for abstraction.
Backend
Server Framework: Node.js
Handles API calls, calculations, and database interactions.
Database:
PostgreSQL for relational needs (e.g., optimized queries for voting).
APIs:
Google Places API: For venue search (e.g., coffee shops).
Google Distance Matrix API: For travel distance and time calculations.
Google Maps Geocoding API: For converting addresses to coordinates (and vice versa).

APIs to Integrate
Google Maps Platform
Google Maps JavaScript API:
Embedding maps, adding interactive pins.
Google Places API:
Venue search for locations near the calculated central point.
Google Distance Matrix API:
Distance and travel time calculations for participants.
Google Geocoding API:
Convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa.

Workflows
Google Maps Integration (Voting on Locations)
Organizer creates an event and uses a map interface to propose locations.
Participants view proposed locations on the map and vote for their preferred option.
Votes are tallied, and results are updated in real time.
Distance Viewer
Participants input their location or enable geolocation.
For each proposed location, distances and travel times are calculated via the Distance Matrix API.
Participants view distances and can click a button to open Google Maps for navigation.
Optimal Location Finder
Participants submit their locations (securely).
Backend computes a central point to minimize travel distances.
Places API fetches nearby venues based on the central point.
Organizer reviews and finalizes the optimal location.

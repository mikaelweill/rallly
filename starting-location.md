# Starting Location Feature Specification

## Overview
The Starting Location feature allows participants to set their starting location for optimized venue selection. This document outlines the improved UX flow and implementation details.

## Map Display Rules

### 1. Visibility
- Map should be visible to BOTH administrators and voters
- Map input sections (address bar, transport mode, etc.) should only be visible when in voting mode (new/edit)
- Map input sections appear automatically when clicking the "+" to add/edit votes

### 2. Positioning
For Non-Optimized Polls:
- Map appears ABOVE the voting section
- This applies to both admin and voter views

For Optimized Polls:
- Map appears BELOW the voting section
- This applies to both admin and voter views

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Map Visibility & Position âœ…
- [x] Ensure map is visible in admin view
- [ ] Add map to voter view
- [x] Position map correctly based on poll type:
  - Non-optimized: Above voting section
  - Optimized: Below voting section
- [x] Integrate map with voting form structure
  - Map is now properly nested inside VotingForm
  - Save/Cancel buttons appear below both map and voting sections

### Phase 2: Voting Form Integration (In Progress)
- [x] Tie map input sections to voting form state
- [x] Show/hide input sections based on voting mode
- [ ] Handle location state in voting form context

### Phase 3: Input Flow (Pending)
- [ ] Implement immediate pin dropping
- [ ] Add transport mode selection
- [ ] Handle pin dragging
- [ ] Update address field automatically

### Phase 4: Data Integration (Pending)
- [ ] Update mutation to handle location with votes
- [ ] Add optimistic updates
- [ ] Handle error states
- [ ] Add loading states

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Initial State (View Mode)
- Map section appears based on poll type:
  - Non-Optimized: ABOVE voting section
  - Optimized: BELOW voting section
- Map is in view-only mode showing existing participant locations (if any)
- No input fields are shown initially

### 2. Location Input Flow (Edit/New Mode)
When user clicks "+" to add/edit votes:
1. Location input section appears automatically with:
   - Search bar with Google Places autocomplete
   - "Use current location" button
   - Map becomes interactive
   - Transport mode selection (for non-optimized polls)

2. Pin Dropping Behavior:
   - Pin drops IMMEDIATELY when:
     - User selects an address from autocomplete
     - User clicks on map
     - User uses current location
   - Address field updates automatically when pin moves
   - Pin can be dragged to adjust location
   - Pin appears in a "temporary" style until confirmed

3. Confirmation Flow:
   - User reviews location with dropped pin
   - Location is saved along with votes when the voting form is submitted
   - Clicking "Cancel" on the voting form:
     - Removes temporary pin
     - Clears input
     - Returns to view-only mode

### 3. Post-Confirmation State
- Location appears in participant list with:
  - Numbered marker matching map
  - Participant name
  - Address
- Map returns to view-only mode

## Next Steps
1. Add map to voter view using the same integration pattern as admin view
2. Complete the voting form integration for location data
3. Implement the input flow with pin dropping functionality
4. Add data integration with proper error handling

## Notes
- All location operations should be cancelable via the voting form
- Clear visual distinction between temporary and confirmed locations
- Maintain existing vote data when adding/updating location
- Consider mobile-friendly interactions for map
- Add proper error handling for geocoding failures
- Ensure consistent behavior between admin and voter views

## UI Components

### Map Component
```typescript
interface MapProps {
  mode: 'view' | 'edit';
  temporaryLocation?: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
    address: string;
  };
  confirmedLocations: Array<{
    id: string;
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
    address: string;
    participantName: string;
  }>;
  onLocationSelect?: (location: { lat: number; lng: number }) => void;
}
```

### Location Input Component
```typescript
interface LocationInputProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (address: string) => void;
  onLocationSelect: (location: { 
    address: string;
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  }) => void;
  isEditing: boolean;
}
```

## Integration with Voting

### Key Changes
1. Tie map input visibility to voting form state
2. Save location along with votes in single transaction
3. Show/hide input sections based on voting form mode (new/edit/view)
4. Position map based on poll optimization status

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface ParticipantSubmission {
  votes: Array<{
    optionId: string;
    type: VoteType;
  }>;
  startLocation?: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    address: string;
  };
}
```
